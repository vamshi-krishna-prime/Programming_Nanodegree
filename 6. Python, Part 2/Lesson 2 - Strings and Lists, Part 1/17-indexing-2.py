'''
Indexing starts from '0', so the  index count is always one less than
actual length.

# Try this in the interpreter
>>> "abc"[0]
'a'

>>> "abc"[2]
'c'

>>> "waffles"[1]
'a'

>>> dinner = "falafels"
>>> dinner[4]

>>> ["a", "b", "c"][2]
'c'

>>> [1, 2, 3, 4][0]
1

>>> colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
>>> colors[1]
'green'

>>> countdown = [3, 2, 1, "blastoff!"]
>>> countdown[3]
