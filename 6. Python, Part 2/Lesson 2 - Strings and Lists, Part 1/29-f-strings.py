# Do it in the terminal:
'''
f-strings is something that was added to Python in version 3.6â€”
so in order for this to work on your own computer, you must be sure
to have Python 3.6 or later. As a reminder, you can check which version
you have by going to your terminal and entering:

python3 --version
'''
>>> import math
>>> import math
3.141592653589793
>>> f"pi is about {math.pi:.6}"
pi is about 3.14159
# This is because of ':.6' inside f-strings (formatted strings)

'''
Suppose that we want to get the following string:

'The aardwolf eats termites.'
'''

>>> animal = "aardwolf"
>>> food = "termites"
>>> "The " + animal + " eats " + food + "."
# Works

>>> animal = "aardwolf"
>>> food = "termites"
>>> "The {animal} eats {food}"
# Doesn't work.

>>> animal = "aardwolf"
>>> food = "termites"
>>> f"The " {animal} " eats " {food} "."
# Doesn't work.

>>> animal = "aardwolf"
>>> food = "termites"
>>> f"The {animal} eats {food}."
# Works
