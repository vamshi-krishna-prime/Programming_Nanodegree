# Operations on lists

'''
Here are some things that actually work on all sequence types:

1. the indexing operation
2. the slicing operation
3. the len function

To get a feeling for how these operations work on lists,
here are some examples you can try in interpreter:
'''

>>> my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
>>> my_list[1]
'b'

>>> my_list[0:2]
['a', 'b']

>>> len(my_list)
4

>>> my_list[3] == "d"
True

>>> len(['Queen', 'rules'])
2
