## Introduction
![Python Text Based Gameplay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49973760/62416420-283d6400-b658-11e9-961b-6074332b7e0d.PNG)

The aim of this project is to make a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game using Python coding skills leanrt through out the Nanodegree program. `The approxiamate time of gameplay is 4-6 hours`.

**The Aim of the project is as follows:**
+ The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
+ Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
+ The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
+ The game has conditions for winning and losing.
+ When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

## Instructions
+ Use Command line shell like GitBash to run the python program - [install Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ If you are a beginner, follow the steps in this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)

## Game Play
1. Start with choosing the name of the player - `Enter Player Name`
2. Choose the desired location  - `Pick a location`
3. Unravel the story depending on various factors - `Story Triggers`
4. Visist locations at night time for different game scenarios - `Night Events`
5. Play mini games to accquire items / unlock game story - `Mini games`
6. Interact using various items in your inventory - `Upgrade Player stash`
7. Level up by buying items from merchants - `Level up`
8. Explore hidden areas to find rare items - `Hidden chests`

 
### Additional features successfully implemented:
+ Mini games for earning gold and other important quest items.
+ One on one fights which depend on player's stats.
+ Day and Night scenarios, Random events and game triggers for improved gameplay.
+ Validation of user's input without crashing the game.

## Contribution:
Contributons are welcome as long as your code follows the below style guidelines:
+ Use of individual functions for each location to be added.
+ Use/modification of global variables only when necessary.
+ Use of local variables for location based triggers
+ validate user's input and give a chance to try again without crashing the program.

#### Possible Improvements

+ Addition of locations to venture into.
+ Expand the game story.

## Technologies Used

+ Python
+ Git
+ GitBash
