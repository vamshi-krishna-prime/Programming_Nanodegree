# Weather API
This project is part of - `"Intro to the Programming" Nanodegree` at `Udacity` learning platform.
The goal of the project is to dislpay the weather conditions of the specified locarion for the next one week, using the Python language. The live version of the project can be accessed using this [Link](https://vamshi-krishna-prime.github.io/Weather%20API/).

## Introduction
![weatherAPI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49973760/62416786-b74d7a80-b65e-11e9-997c-0c860ab26154.PNG)

**The Aim of the project is as follows:**

+ The aim of this project is to implement the python coding skills accquired through out the Nanodegree program to accquire the specified locarion's weather report for the next 6 days.
+ Succesfully convert the accquired weather data from dictionaries format to well structured readable format.

## Instructions
1. Enter the desired location - `Choose Location`
2. Check the location for the 'disambiguate_locations' - `Locations with same part of the name`
3. Validate the location and let the user try again - `let the user try again`
4. Display an error message without crashing the program in case of connection loss. - `server not responding`

## Requirements
+ Use Command line shell like GitBash to run the python program - [install Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ If you are a beginner, follow the steps in this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
+ If using GitBash, install **'requests'** package using the following commands before executing the python code:
```
pip install requests
```
